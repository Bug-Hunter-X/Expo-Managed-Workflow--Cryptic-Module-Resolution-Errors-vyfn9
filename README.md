# Expo Managed Workflow: Cryptic Module Resolution Errors

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered in Expo's managed workflow. The error involves module resolution or missing dependency issues during the build process, despite seemingly correct package installations.  The root cause can be subtle and vary, making debugging challenging.  This example showcases the issue and its solution.

## Problem

When building an Expo project (using the managed workflow), you might encounter obscure errors related to module resolution or missing dependencies.  These errors can occur even if the necessary modules are installed via npm or yarn.  The error messages are often not very descriptive, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact problem. 

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking several aspects of your project's configuration and dependencies:

1. **Verify Package Installation:** Double-check that all necessary packages are installed and their versions are compatible.
2. **Correct Import Paths:** Ensure that the import statements in your code correctly point to the modules' locations.
3. **Native Modules (if applicable):**  If using native modules, confirm that they are correctly linked to your project.
4. **Expo SDK Version:**  Ensure your Expo SDK version is compatible with the packages you're using.
5. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, a simple `expo prebuild` and a fresh build can resolve the issue.
6. **Check for typos in module names.**
7. **Check for conflicting dependencies.**

This repository provides example code demonstrating the issue and how it can be resolved.
