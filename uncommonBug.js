This error occurs when using the Expo managed workflow and attempting to import a module that isn't properly configured or included in your project's dependencies.  It typically manifests as a cryptic error message during the build process, and the exact error message can vary.  For instance, you might see errors related to module resolution or a missing dependency, even though the module appears to be installed.  The problem might stem from mismatched versions of packages, incorrect import paths, or a failure to correctly link native modules (if applicable).
